Role: nodejs
=========

Purpose
--------
This role is for MacOS Homebrew users that wish to install npm global packages without resorting to the use of sudo.

When node is installed via Homebrew, and `npm install` is run with `-g` flag, it installs the requested packages in 
the default directory of `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`.  

This directory requires root privileges for write and will inevitably result in permissions being changed on files that 
will cause errors and conflict with Homebrew's semantics.

This role will install Node via Homebrew without NPM, and install the latest NPM separately into a configurable 
directory (*defaults to the user's home*).

It will set up all environment variables for Node and Npm binarys so that things go neatly into this new home.
